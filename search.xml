        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>　古代から、似た物語はたくさんある。ドラマ（注1）作りで大事なのは新しい筋立て（注2）やエピソードを無理やりひねり出すことより、作者独自の考え方を、ドラマに載せて表現することなのだろう。十代の私は、そう気づいた。しかし「自分の考え」をどうやって確立するか。自分の考えのつもりでも、人の意見に引きずられているかもしれない。</p><p>　そこで新聞を使った「修業」を思いついた。毎朝、新聞を適当に開き、目をつぶって紙面を指す。そして指先に触れたところに載っていた記事の中の人物になりきって「この後、どうすればこの問題が解決するか。どう振舞うのがベストなのか。」を毎日、真剣に想像した。</p><p>　これを繰り返すうち、自分なりの考え方をきちんと言葉で表現する大切さが分かってきた。そして自分が何を表現したのかも、おぼろげ（注3）ながら見えてきた。</p><p>　突き詰めると、私は「ヒロインが何を考えているか」を描きたかったのだ。</p><p>　それまでの少女漫画には、主人公である少女が能動的に動く物語が少ないように感じていた。それよりヒロインの喜怒哀楽、感情が描かれることが多かった。でも私は、自ら考え決心して生き方を選ぶ少女を描きたかった。</p><p>　そのため私の作品では、何かを決意するまでのヒロインの試行錯誤が長い。第一読者である担当編集者には「理屈っぽい」と言われ続けている。「ヒロインが泣くときに読者が共感してくれるんだ」とアドバイスされても、泣く前に考える女性を描き続けた。</p>]]></content>

      <title>about my postcard</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1.Qingdao is a beautiful coastal city in eastern China’s Shandong Province, known for its beaches, seafood, and German-style architecture. Once a German colony, it still preserves historic buildings like St. Michael’s Cathedral and old villas in Badaguan. The city is famous for Tsingtao Beer, brewed since 1903, and hosts the vibrant Qingdao International Beer Festival every summer. Nature lovers enjoy Mount Laoshan, a scenic Taoist mountain. With a mix of tradition and modern industry, Qingdao is also home to major companies like Haier. Its charm, culture, and ocean views make it a popular destination for both tourists and business travelers.</p><p>2.I just created an Instagram account yesterday to connect with people for postcard exchanges. However, after sending a few DMs, my account was suddenly restricted. I immediately submitted an appeal and anxiously waited, assuming I might lose the account for good. To my surprise, it was restored within an hour! The experience made me cautious—I’ll avoid aggressive liking or messaging for now.<br>Work has been quiet today, with little on my plate. I considered sourcing some products, but many items are hard to find reliable Chinese suppliers for, as they’re rarely manufactured locally.<br>This week, I’m excited to attend a collaborative postcard-design event in Chengdu—my first time joining such a meetup! I look forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts and brainstorming creative ideas together.</p><p>3.7. This morning, I had one egg and half a boiled corn—very light. I almost finished reading the diaries I wrote during college on WPS and gained some new insights. Not sure if I should wash my hair tonight. I also plan to continue writing postcards, which is quite time-consuming—even pre-made ones take a long time to copy. After revisiting the content I wrote when setting up my blog, I feel like blogging again. Hiring a programmer on Xianyu to build a website costs 50 RMB, but I’d still need to buy a domain and use Alibaba Cloud, which feels like a hassle. Maintenance later would also cost money. My Qingdao postcards were selected, so I can only send five to that netizen. How many non-boxed postcards should I give as compensation? No new Postcrossing email notifications in my inbox yet. Recently, I mailed the postcards that already had stamps. It was a bit chilly this morning, but I managed to follow yesterday’s plan: dress warmly, bring an umbrella, and carry sanitary pads—all done in the short time before leaving.  </p><p>In the evening, I biked to the Incubation Park while listening to Fujii Kaze’s music. Why is “Shiroi” so popular with so many likes? It’s way too overhyped—I think it’s just okay. The sunlight during the ride made it a bit warm. Both today and yesterday, colleagues ate ice cream—was it really that hot? Though some people eat ice cream even in winter. Vickie treated us to some premium-brand ice cream. So many people got on at Century City Station. Yesterday, four colleagues passed their probation period, and today Lily treated us to afternoon tea. I ordered a strawberry milkshake, which was pretty good—a mix of crushed ice and strawberry bits. I asked for half sugar because I’m worried about the health effects of too much sugar, but my colleagues said it’s fine as long as you don’t drink it daily. Some prefer full sugar, while others are even more sugar-averse than me—one found half sugar too sweet since there was no 30% sugar option.  </p><p>I’m tempted to mention on Postcrossing that I like Fujii Kaze—what if I meet a fellow fan? Even after arriving at Haichang Road Station, there were still many people left. Meimei Yao Facai was curiously asking about the 2.8 RMB hat I bought, lol. Today, I reviewed about 10-20 Japanese grammar points but haven’t finished the N1 material yet—probably will tomorrow. Bringing a book was definitely useful. Saw that Hainan University made it into the top 100 of the Soft Science rankings—so gratifying, though it’s out of my league academically. Hope they recruit even better talent this year. The newly constructed building looks really nice. My coach asked me to do cardio today, but I’ll go tomorrow—working out takes too much time.  </p><p>Feeling like my period might be coming—my underwear feels damp, but no stomach pain. Thinking of using Twitter to find postcard pals and Instagram to connect with Japanese people. I want to practice Japanese more since writing daily logs in English has already improved my English skills. Arrived at Xibocheng Station by 18:37—so fast! Remembered how a woman rushed into the train yesterday and almost got caught in the doors. I was so startled I yelled, “Don’t come in!”</p>]]></content>

My dad was using a needle to inject liquid into a tree, causing it to die. We bought two kilograms of peanuts, and after planting, only a few taels remained. They were planted on a slope, and my grandmother hoed the ground, her face dripping with sweat.here is the farm we worked on.<br><img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505031314226.jpg"></p>]]></content>
