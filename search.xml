        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently,I’ve exchanged postcards on instagram and facebook,here is my outgoing.I just created an Instagram account yesterday to connect with people for postcard exchanges. However, after sending a few DMs, my account was suddenly restricted. I immediately submitted an appeal and anxiously waited, assuming I might lose the account for good. To my surprise, it was restored within an hour! The experience made me cautious—I’ll avoid aggressive liking or messaging for now.<br>Work has been quiet today, with little on my plate. I considered sourcing some products, but many items are hard to find reliable Chinese suppliers for, as they’re rarely manufactured locally.<br>This week, I’m excited to attend a collaborative postcard-design event in Chengdu—my first time joining such a meetup! I look forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts and brainstorming creative ideas together.</p><!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head>  <meta charset="UTF-8">  <title>水平滑动图片画廊</title>  <style>    .gallery-container {      overflow-x: auto;      white-space: nowrap;      padding: 10px;    }<pre><code>.gallery-container img &#123;  display: inline-block;  width: 30%; /* 每张图占据30%宽度 */  margin-right: 10px;  border-radius: 10px;&#125;/* 可选：隐藏滚动条（仍可滑动） */.gallery-container::-webkit-scrollbar &#123;  display: none;&#125;</code></pre><p>  </style></p></head><body>  <div class="gallery-container">    <img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505050956718.jpg" alt="Image 1">    <img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505050956718.jpg" alt="Image 1">    <img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505050956718.jpg" alt="Image 1">    <img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505050956718.jpg" alt="Image 1">    <!-- 可继续添加更多图片 -->  </div></body></html>]]></content>

My dad was using a needle to inject liquid into a tree, causing it to die. We bought two kilograms of peanuts, and after planting, only a few taels remained. They were planted on a slope, and my grandmother hoed the ground, her face dripping with sweat.here is the farm we worked on.<br><img src="https://blog-1357580636.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/Blog/202505031314226.jpg"></p>]]></content>
